- Added a new prompt that shows if the user has an invalid private key on an existing profile when running the `zssh config setup` command.

- Added support for listing all USS files with the `all` request option. When provided, the CLI plug-in includes hidden files in the list response. [#421](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-native-proto/pull/421)
- Added support for the `encoding` option to the `zssh upload uss` and the `zssh upload ds` commands. When the `encoding` option is provided, the command uses the option value as the target encoding for the uploaded content. [#427](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-native-proto/issues/427)
