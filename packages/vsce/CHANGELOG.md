## `0.2.0`

- Renamed `SshConfigUtils` class to `ConfigUtils` to avoid naming conflicts with SDK files [#614](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-native-proto/pull/614)
- Added new `defaultHandshakeTimeout` VS Code setting to allow users to customize the handshake timeout when not specified in the profile. [#605](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-native-proto/pull/605)
- Fixed SSH client caching to be per profile instead of per hostname, allowing multiple server instances on the same system. [#558](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-native-proto/pull/558)

## `0.1.10`

- Updated the `Zowe-SSH: Connect to Host...` command to prompt the user to choose a deploy directory. [#527](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-native-proto/issues/527)

## `0.1.9`

- Moved `showSessionInTree` call to before `uninstallServer` is called to ensure the session is displayed in the tree before the uninstall removes it. [#484](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-native-proto/issues/484)
- Filtered out certain information messages to display a clear and concise error message for when creating a data set with an invalid management class. [#502](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-native-proto/issues/502)

- Fixed error when using SSH profiles in Zowe Explorer 3.3.0. [#540](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-native-proto/issues/540)
- Fixed an issue where the `Zowe-SSH: Connect to Host...` command did not prompt the user for a password if the given private key was not recognized by the host. [#524](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-native-proto/issues/524)
- Added a new prompt that shows if the user has an invalid private key on an existing profile when running the `Zowe-SSH: Connect to Host...` command. Now, if an invalid private key is detected, it is moved to a new comment in the JSON file and the user is given options to proceed. They can undo the comment action, delete the comment entirely, or preserve the comment and succeed with setup. [#524](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-native-proto/issues/524)
- Added a new error handler that integrates with Zowe Explorer to provide detailed troubleshooting information for connection failures, authentication issues, and server deployment problems.

## `0.1.7`

- Fixed regression in performance where opening data sets and USS files in the editor could be slow. [#488](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-native-proto/pull/488)

## `0.1.5`

- Implemented the `getTag` function in the `SshUssApi` class to return the tag of a UNIX file. Now, the VS Code extension automatically detects the file tag before the file is opened, and the detected encoding is shown in the "Open with Encoding" menu in Zowe Explorer. [#346](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-native-proto/issues/346)
- Adopted streaming for API methods that upload/download data sets and USS files. [#358](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-native-proto/pull/358)

- Enhanced SSH profile validation to auto-deploy server when it is missing or out of date. [#44](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-native-proto/issues/44)

## `0.1.1`

- Fixed issue where a jobs list request returns unexpected results whenever a search query does not match any jobs. [#217](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-native-proto/pull/217)
- Fixed issue where data set save requests sometimes resulted in an unexpected conflict error. [#219](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-native-proto/pull/219)
- Fixed issue where Server Install Path setting did not work. [#220](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-native-proto/pull/220)

## `0.1.0`

- Updated error handling for listing data sets. [#185](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-native-proto/pull/185)
- Added support for conflict detection through use of e-tags. When a data set or USS file is opened, the e-tag is received by the VS Code extension and used in future write requests to prevent overwriting new changes on the target system.
