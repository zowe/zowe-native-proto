The Zowe Native Protocol extension for Zowe Explorer offers several features powered by the Zowe Native Protocol, enabling developers to interact with mainframe resources directly from their IDE.

## Features

- **USS File Access**: Create, read, write, and delete files and directories in Unix System Services
- **Job Management**: Submit, view, cancel, hold, and release jobs on z/OS

## Minimum Requirements

- VS Code 1.73.0 (or newer)
- Zowe Explorer v3.1.0 (or newer)

## Installation

## Usage

To deploy an instance of the Zowe Native Protocol server, run the `Zowe-SSH: Connect to Host...` command from the command palette.
